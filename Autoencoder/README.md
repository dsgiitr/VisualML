# Simple Autoencoder for browser

**Train a model to autoencode handwritten digits from the MNIST database using Fully Connected Neural Network written in `Tfjs`
<br> The MNIST dataset is used as training data.**

## Features

- `Select the structure for the DenseNet and see the performance of the model. `

- `Sample autoencoded MNIST Digits can be seen`

- `2D Visualize the encoded space of the autoencoder, see the decoded digit for the corresponding latent point`  

- `Autoencode your digit drawing`

## Installation

- `Download the project folder and run index.html in your browser`
